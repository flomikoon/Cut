Apart from the cost, shared flats and houses are often in poor condition.
Landlords are slow to spend their profits on repairs.
I was fairly lucky with mine.
The house I lived in was scruffy, but the landlord took action when needed — like the time the bathroom ceiling fell in.
I’d just run a bath and had returned to my room to get something, when I heard a loud crash.
I went back to find the bathtub full of wet plaster.
I had the ceiling repaired and took the bill to my landlord.
