rt from the cost, shared flats and houses are often in poor condition.
dlords are slow to spend their profits on repairs.
as fairly lucky with mine.
 house I lived in was scruffy, but the landlord took action when needed ï¿½ like the time the bathroom ceiling fell in.
 just run a bath and had returned to my room to get something, when I heard a loud crash.
ent back to find the bathtub full of wet plaster.
ad the ceiling repaired and took the bill to my landlord.
